# Civilization Maintenance Manual (CMM)

The Civilization Maintenance Manual (CMM) is the custodial doctrine for Taproot.

It defines the operating assumptions, failure modes, design constraints, and continuity requirements necessary to maintain human–machine systems across time, personnel turnover, and environmental stress.

This is not a vision document.  
This is not a manifesto.  
This is a maintenance manual.

## Purpose

The CMM exists to answer one question:

**What must be continuously maintained for a civilization-scale system to remain sane, functional, and recoverable?**

It treats civilization as:
- A long-running system
- Operated by imperfect humans
- Under persistent entropy, drift, capture, and collapse pressure

---

## Scope

The manual covers:
- Behavioral and cognitive control surfaces
- Human–AI coauthoring and exoself design
- Trust, memory, and accountability infrastructure
- Energy, attention, and system metabolism
- Infrastructure resilience and local sovereignty
- Regenerative capacities and intergenerational stewardship
- Audits, failure modes, revocation, and recovery

It explicitly avoids:
- Moralizing language
- Aspirational governance claims
- Solutionism detached from operating conditions

---

## Audience

This manual is written for **operators and custodians**, not spectators.

Primary audience:
- System designers
- Civic stewards
- Infrastructure maintainers
- Institutional custodians
- Human–AI system operators

Secondary audience:
- Observers seeking to understand system constraints (see FM-6)

If you are looking for persuasion, onboarding, or public education material, this is not the correct document.

## Structure

The manual is organized as follows:

- **Front Matter (FM-0 → FM-6)**  
  Definitions, constraints, threat model, liability, and reading posture.

- **Parts I–VII**  
  Load-bearing system domains, written as operational doctrine.

- **Appendices (A–F)**  
  Glossary, case studies, design patterns, audits, ethical red lines, and open questions.

Section identifiers (FM-#, Part #, Appendix #) are stable references and must not be renumbered without an explicit revision entry.
